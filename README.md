# MMM-TeslaFi

This an extension for the [MagicMirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror).

With this module, you can display the status of your Tesla vehicle from [TeslaFi](https://www.teslafi.com/signup.php?referred=warlrus). Many different pieces of data can be shown, such as the battery level, temperature, lock status and plenty more!
A valid TeslaFi API key is required, the key can be requested [here](https://teslafi.com/api.php)

This is a partial re-write of the original MMM-TeslaFi by [f00d4tehg0dz](https://github.com/f00d4tehg0dz), which can be found [here](https://github.com/f00d4tehg0dz/MMM-TeslaFi). I have chosen to not merge this version back in as it breaks some functionality of the original module.

I am happy to accept any [bug reports](https://github.com/mattdy/MMM-TeslaFi/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/mattdy/MMM-TeslaFi/pulls) for new features or fixes.

## Installation

Open a terminal session, navigate to your MagicMirror's `modules` folder and execute the following commands:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/mattdy/MMM-TeslaFi.git
$ cd MMM-TeslaFi
$ npm install
```

Alternatively, you can install automatically using the excellent [Magic Mirror Package Manager](https://github.com/Bee-Mar/mmpm)

```console
$ mmpm -i MMM-TeslaFi
```

Once installed, you should then activate the module by adding it to the config.js file as shown here:

```javascript
modules: [
  {
    module: "MMM-TeslaFi",
    position: "top_left",
    config: {
      source: {
        name: "teslafi",
        apiKey: "ENTER YOUR KEY HERE"
      }
    }
  }
];
```

You can then use the various configuration options below to customise how the module is displayed. By default, all fields will be shown. You can set the `items` configuration option to an array of field names as shown in
[Available fields](#available-fields) to limit the number of data items shown.

## Config Options

### Data Source

The `source` configuration option defines which data source you want to use to pull Tesla data from. At the moment there are two available options, which are configured as shown below. Note that some data fields may not be available from some data sources due to API differences.

#### TeslaFi

You should obtain your API key from [TeslaFi.com](https://teslafi.com/api.php) and configure the module as follows:

```javascript
modules: [
  {
    module: "MMM-TeslaFi",
    position: "top_left",
    config: {
      source: {
        name: "teslafi",
        apiKey: "ENTER YOUR KEY HERE",
        apiCommand: `lastGoodTemp`
      }
    }
  }
];
```

The `apiCommand` configuration variable is optional, see [TeslaFi](https://teslafi.com/api.php) for possible values.

#### Tessie

You should obtain your access token from [Tessie.com](https://my.tessie.com/settings/api), as well as the VIN code of the vehicle you wish to display, and configure the module as follows

```javascript
modules: [
  {
    module: "MMM-TeslaFi",
    position: "top_left",
    config: {
      source: {
        name: "tessie",
        apiKey: "ENTER YOUR ACCESS TOKEN HERE",
        vin: "ENTER YOUR VIN HERE"
      }
    }
  }
];
```

### Maps Configuration

The `maps` configuration option takes the following sub-options, which allow you to configure a static Google Maps display of the vehicles current location.
See [Map section](#map) below for more information

| Option           | Details                                                                                                | Example                                    |

- Some fields (charge-time, charge-added, charge-power) are only enabled if the vehicle is plugged in
- Some fields (version, speed, heading) are only enabled if the vehicle is not driving
- The temperature field may not be populated if you use TeslaFi's sleep mode, which will stop this row from showing entirely. You may need to use `apiCommand: "lastGoodTemp"` if this fails to show
- For details on TeslaFi's 'location' tags, see [TeslaFi Locations](https://teslafi.com/locations.php)

## Map

In order to enable the `map` field, you must first have created a Google Maps API key from the [Google Maps Developer Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/overview). This is easy to do, and comes
with ~100,000 free calls per month. Once you have created the API key, you must enable the "Maps Static API". Once you have done this, add the API key to your configuration and add the `map` field to your list of items.
This will show a non-interactive map of the vehicles location. The size of this map can be configured with the `maps` configuration options, as in the example below. Note that you will not be able to zoom or move the map with touch/mouse functionality.

```
modules: [
  {
    module: "MMM-TeslaFi",
    position: "top_left",
    config: {
      apiKey: "ENTER YOUR TESLAFI KEY HERE",
      maps: {
        apiKey: "ENTER YOUR GOOGLE MAPS KEY HERE",
        zoom: 12,
        width: 300,
        height: 300,
        drivingOnly: true
      }
    }
  }
];
```

## Contributing

If you have an idea for an additional field, then please raise an [issue](https://github.com/mattdy/MMM-TeslaFi/issues) with the `enhancement` label. Alternatively, please feel free to develop the new functionality yourself and submit a
[pull request](https://github.com/mattdy/MMM-TeslaFi/pulls) - I'd be delighted to incorporate any new fields.

In order to keep the code as accessible as possible, there are Github Actions defined to run `eslint` (JS & CSS) and `prettier` checks against all Pull Requests. Additionally, `prettier` is automatically run on merges to the `master` branch.

Finally, if you find this module useful and would like to make a small contribution to the primary developer ([mattdy](https://github.com/mattdy)) then you can do so at [this link](http://paypal.me/mattdy90).
Alternatively, please consider using my [TeslaFi referral link](https://www.teslafi.com/signup.php?referred=warlrus) if this module has inspired you to subscribe, or my [Tesla referral link](http://ts.la/matthew6411) if this module
has inspired you to buy a Tesla!
